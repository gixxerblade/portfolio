            Iâ€™m a product focused Javascript developer and entrepreneur based in
            North Carolina. After my tenure with Marine Corps, I shifted focus
            to the technology sector and obtained a Bachelors of Science in
            Information Technology. Not one to leave anything to chance, along
            with the passion to become the best version of me, I signed up for a
            program named{" "}

            </A>
            . I went through their course work to learn not only how to become a
            better programmer but to actually understand the craft of building
            products for the web with a{" "}
            <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>team</span>. When I
            was not learning I focused on building a company named{" "}

              Angry Pickles.

            . I am proud to have built a product from scratch that actually
            provides revenue and makes people happy. When I am not building,
            learning or making pickles, I am an avid Cyclist and Gardener.
